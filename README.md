# Ice Raid Bot for One Fruit Simulator

This script automates the ice raid in One Fruit Simulator (Roblox) . It was made specifically for this raid and might not be as effective for others.

# Prerequisites:

Before you get started, you need to install a couple of Python libraries. You can do this by opening your terminal or command prompt and running the following command:
Bash

pip install pyautogui pynput

# How to Use:

The script relies on a specific camera angle, so follow these steps:

    Go to the Second Sea.

    When you first spawn, your camera will be behind your character. You need to respawn

    After you respawn, you'll see that the camera angle is different. Your view will be outside the terrace, looking at your character inside it. This is the correct position to start the script.

Once you are set up, run the script from your terminal and use the following commands to control it:

    p: starts the raid

    l: stops the raid


You can try adding code for another raid, but it probably won't work as well. This script was mainly done for the ice raid, so it's most effective there.
